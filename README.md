# electron
Practice with the framework electron

I wanted to make a native desktop app, so I went with something simple. 
This text editor has all the basic functionality to open, save, and create new text files.

This is not meant to be a replacement for any existing applications, but rather a way to practice javascript development

TO RUN:

After installing node.js for your computer run the commands:

npm run install_electron

npm start

THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED FOR WINDOWS 11 MACHINES
